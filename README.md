## üß© How to contribute & make a PR

I welcome contributions of all sizes ‚Äî from typo fixes to new components. Here‚Äôs the quickest path to a great PR:

### 1) Fork & clone

```bash
# Fork on GitHub (top-right button), then:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-fork-name>.git
cd <your-fork-name>
npm install
```

### 2) Create a feature branch

```bash
# Use a descriptive branch name
git checkout -b feat/case-study-card    # new feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/typo-blog-title     # small fix
```

### 3) Make your changes

- Keep the UI consistent (rounded-2xl, soft rings, accessible focus states)
- Prefer server components where possible; keep client components minimal
- Follow existing file structure under `app/`

### 4) Run locally & verify

```bash
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000 and test the changed pages/components
```

### 5) Commit with a clear message

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(case-studies): add case study card with metrics and CTAs"
```

### 6) Push & open the PR

```bash
git push origin feat/case-study-card
```

- Open a PR from your branch to this repo‚Äôs **main**:  
  https://github.com/TheAnandThakkar/anandthakkar/compare
- Describe **what changed**, **why**, and add **screenshots/GIFs** for UI.
- Link any related issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).

### 7) PR checklist (speeds up review)

- [ ] Builds locally (`npm run build`) without type errors
- [ ] No obvious console errors/warnings
- [ ] Accessible (labels, alt text, focus rings)
- [ ] Mobile/desktop screenshots included for UI changes
- [ ] Small, focused scope ‚Äî larger ideas are great too, but split if possible
